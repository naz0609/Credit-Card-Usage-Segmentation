# Credit-Card-Usage-Segmentation
This project focused on segmenting credit card customers based on their spending patterns, payment behaviors, and credit usage to enable personalized marketing, manage risks, and maximize profits. Using clustering techniques like K-Means and Agglomerative Clustering, customers were divided into 4 segments .
# customers were divided into segments such as "Big Spenders," "Everyday Essentials Users," "Credit-Reliant Borrowers," and "Minimal Users."
# Key Features:

Dataset: 18 features, 8950+ customers.
Techniques Used: Feature engineering (e.g., credit utilization ratio, payment ratio), K-Means (K=4), hierarchical clustering.
Evaluation Metrics: Silhouette score, elbow method.
Tools and Technologies: Python, machine learning algorithms, data visualization.
# Outcome:

Identified unique customer segments for targeted offers.
Improved customer retention and satisfaction with tailored perks.
Enhanced risk management strategies to minimize defaults.
# Future Scope:
Incorporate predictive models to refine segmentation and explore deeper customer behavior insights.
